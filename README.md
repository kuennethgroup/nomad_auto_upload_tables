# nomad-auto-upload-tables

A NOMAD Oasis plugin, developed by the Kuenneth Research Group, that automatically
guesses a schema/ontology for an uploaded Excel (`.xlsx`/`.xls`) or CSV
file, and lets the user review and correct that guess directly in NOMAD's
normal entry editor before the data is turned into structured, queryable
data.

## How it works

1. Drop any `.xlsx`/`.xls`/`.csv` file into a NOMAD upload. A `TabularGuess`
   entry is created automatically (`parsers/tabular_guess.py`).
2. For every column, propose:
   - a quantity name (`guessed_name`)
   - a data type (`guessed_type`: string/integer/float/boolean/datetime)
   - a unit, e.g. parsed out of headers like `"Temperature (K)"` or `"Pressure [Pa]"`
   - an ontology category (`category`): sample id, composition, temperature,
     pressure, time, mass, ... (see `CATEGORIES` in `guessing.py`)
   - a confidence score

   If an OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint is configured (`api_key`
   and `model` set, see below), an AI call (`ai_guessing.py`) makes this guess
   from the column headers/dtypes/sample values. Otherwise — or if that call
   fails for any reason (bad key, network, unparseable response) — it falls
   back to local heuristics (`guessing.py`: keyword matching against a small
   controlled vocabulary, pandas dtypes, unit regexes). The entry's
   `ai_assisted` flag records which path was taken.
3. Open the entry in the NOMAD GUI. Every guessed field is a normal
   ELN-editable form field — fix any wrong guesses, untick `include` to drop
   a column, etc.
4. Tick `confirm_schema` and save. This rebuilds `rows` (one per source
   spreadsheet row, each holding the included columns as name/value/unit
   triples) from your corrected mapping.

Re-running "reprocess" on an upload will not clobber a confirmed entry: the
parser checks `confirm_schema` and is a no-op once it's set.

## Configuring the AI endpoint

The parser entry point (`nomad_auto_upload_tables.parsers:tabular_guess_parser`) takes
three extra fields, set by an Oasis admin in `nomad.yaml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  entry_points:
    options:
      nomad_auto_upload_tables.parsers:tabular_guess_parser:
        api_key: '<your API key>'
        model: 'your_model'
        base_url: 'https://chat-ai.academiccloud.de/v1' # optional, this is the default
```

`base_url` defaults to GWDG's SAIA service
(https://docs.hpc.gwdg.de/services/ai-services/saia/index.html), which is
OpenAI-compatible, but any OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint works
(OpenAI itself, a local Ollama/vLLM server, etc.) — just set `base_url`
accordingly. Without `api_key`/`model` set, the plugin silently uses the
local heuristics only; no AI call is ever made.

### Scope / what's deliberately not built (yet)

- "Upload a pandas DataFrame" works at the library level only: `guessing.py`
  has no NOMAD or file-IO dependency and operates on a plain `DataFrame`
  (see `guess_columns(df)`), so it can be reused from a script or a future
  programmatic entry point. There isn't a NOMAD concept of uploading an
  in-memory DataFrame directly (uploads are file-based).
- The schema-review UI is NOMAD's stock entry editor (driven by the ELN
  annotations on `GuessedColumn`/`TabularGuess`), not a bespoke screen. A
  fancier interactive UI would require a NORTH tool (Docker container behind
  JupyterHub) — out of scope for this first version.
- The structured output (`GuessedProperty.value`) is stored as text, not
  typed `Quantity` values — NOMAD's metainfo system doesn't support
  synthesizing brand-new `Quantity` definitions at runtime, only filling
  instances of pre-declared ones.

## Development

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run pytest tests/
```

`guessing.py` has no `nomad` dependency and is tested standalone. The
schema package and parser are exercised against the real `nomad-lab`
package in `tests/test_tabular_guess.py`, and can be run end-to-end with:

```bash
uv run nomad parse tests/data/sample.csv --show-archive
uv run nomad parse tests/data/sample.xlsx --show-archive
```

## Installing this plugin into a docker-compose NOMAD Oasis

Plugins for a docker-compose-based Oasis are **not** added by editing
`docker-compose.yaml` or volume-mounting this repo. Modern Oasis deployments
(based on [`nomad-distro-template`](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-distro-template))
bake plugins into a custom-built image via a CI pipeline, driven entirely by
that *distro* repo's `pyproject.toml` — `docker-compose.yaml` itself needs no
changes.

This repo is at [kuennethgroup/nomad_auto_upload_tables](https://github.com/kuennethgroup/nomad_auto_upload_tables).

In your Oasis distro repo:

1. Push this plugin to GitHub (`git push origin main`) if you haven't already.
2. In the distro repo's `pyproject.toml`, add this plugin under
   `[project.optional-dependencies].plugins`, pinned to a commit or tag:

   ```toml
   [project.optional-dependencies]
   plugins = [
       "nomad-auto-upload-tables @ git+https://github.com/kuennethgroup/nomad_auto_upload_tables.git@<commit-or-tag>",
   ]
   ```

3. Commit and push to the distro repo's main branch — its CI builds a new
   image with this plugin installed.
4. On the Oasis host:

   ```bash
   docker compose pull
   docker compose up -d
   ```

If you're not yet using `nomad-distro-template`, the same `pyproject.toml`
mechanism applies wherever your Oasis image build configures its plugin
list — find the project that builds the image your `docker-compose.yaml`
references and add this plugin there.
